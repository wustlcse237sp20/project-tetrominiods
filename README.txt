What user stories were completed this iteration?
	As of now, we have implemented the following stories:
		Moving Blocks over Time
		Rotating Blocks (mostly)
		Ensuring Blocks stay within Boundaries
		Minor UI Coloring
		End Screen
		Collision Checks
		'Speed Up' Function by pressing Down
		
What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
		'Preview' Block that shows where piece will go
		Fast Dropping
		Full Rotation for applicable Pieces
		Animated Background
		'Queue' of pieces that will appear
		'Hold' function
		Potentially a pause screen
	
Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
	Clearing Lines once completed. The code has since been removed as it caused runtime errors on run. We plan on getting this working as the first part of our Iteration 2.
	
What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
	Unfortunately, as of writing this, we could not get it to compile through command line, but works perfectly fine if imported through IntelliJ or Eclipse.
